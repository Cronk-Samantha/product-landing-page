        <h3>At our core, we believe...</h3>
        <div class="core-beliefs-container">
            <div class="core-beliefs item1">
                <p>Everything about you is <em>~unique~</em>. Your fingerprints, your personality, and, yes, even your skin 
                is one of a kind.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="core-beliefs item2">
                <p><em>Prevention is key!</em> As we age, our skin naturally loses elasticity, 
                and a combination of enviornmental and biological factors causes our skin to produce less mositure. 
                This can lead to dryness, wrinkles, and even skin infections. Establishing a strong skincare routine now
                can help mitigate these issues and support healthier, more youthful skin in the future.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="core-beliefs item3">
                <p>There is no one-size-fits-all approach to skincare. There are countless products to choose from but, not every product will work for you and your personal needs.
                    This lengthy process of trial and error is frustrating and can lead to people just giving up entirely on their skin. This is why we at Ethereal believe in making the trial
                    phase as short as possible, if a product isn't helping you reach your skin goals - we send you a new one that could just be what your skincare routine has been missing!

                <ol class="ol-parent">
                    <li>As part of the sign up process for our monthly subscription you will be asked to fill
                        out a questionnaire. In it, you will be asked about:
                        <ul class="how-it-works-ul">
                            <li>Any skin conditions/concerns</li>
                            <li>Your skin type (combination, dry, oily, etc..)</li>
                            <li>Your end goal (In a perfect world, my skin would look like...)</li>
                            <li>Previous products/regimens you've tried & why they didn't work</li>
                            <li>If there are brands you like/don't like or any brands you have thought about trying out</li>
                        </ul>
                        This list is not all-inclusive and you are free to provide as much or as little information you want. Although,
                        we do recommend our customers give us at least what is listed above, as the more details we have, the better we can assist you in acheiving your dream skin!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After you finish account set-up, we get to work compiling your first shipment of products. You can expect the first package within 2 weeks 
                        and then it's time for the fun part - sampling! For each product we send out, we detail why it was chosen and the best methods/directions for use. 
                        After a month you will log back onto your portal and tell us your thoughts. What you like about a product, what you didn't like, any changes you noticed, 
                        if you want to try similar products...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our team works on compiling your next set of products based on the feedback you give us. If we don't receive any feedback from you after 32 days from when 
                        your most recent package was delivered, we pause the charges to your account and we don't automatically send out the next month's box until you re-activate 
                        your subscription in your account portal.  
                    </li>
                </ol>
            <h3 class="section3-subheader">And that's it! We will repeat this process until you find your <span class="special-text">~ethereal glow~</span></h3>
