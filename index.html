        <h3>At our core, we believe...</h3>
        <div class="core-beliefs-container">
            <div class="core-beliefs item1">
                <p>Everything about you is <em>~unique~</em>. Your fingerprints, your personality, and, yes, even your skin 
                is one of a kind.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="core-beliefs item2">
                <p><em>Prevention is key!</em> As we age, our skin naturally loses elasticity, 
                and a combination of enviornmental and biological factors causes our skin to produce less mositure. 
                This can lead to dryness, wrinkles, and even skin infections. Establishing a strong skincare routine now
                can help mitigate these issues and support healthier, more youthful skin in the future.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="core-beliefs item3">
                <p>There is no one-size-fits-all approach to skincare. There are countless products to choose from but, not every product will work for you and your personal needs.
                    This lengthy process of trial and error is frustrating and can lead to people just giving up entirely on their skin. This is why we at Ethereal believe in making the trial
                    phase as short as possible, if a product isn't helping you reach your skin goals - we send you a new one that could just be what your skincare routine has been missing!
